INTRODUCTION					    *vim-gista-raw-introduction*

*vim-gista-raw* is a raw API library plugin which helps developers to
manipulate GitHub gists.
This plugin provides basic manipulation features listing below:

The original concepts and source codes are taken from mattn/gist.vim but most
of codes and strategies are aggressively refactered to establish new
implementations (that why I did not fork the gist.vim but create a new one.)
