INTRODUCTION					    *vim-gista-introduction*

*vim-gista* is a plugin which helps users to manipulate GitHub gists.
This plugin provides basic manipulation features listing below:

1.  List gists
    -	The user's personal gists (public and private)
    -	The user's starred gists
    -	All public gists of a specific user
    -	All public gists in GitHub
2.  Open gists
    -	Open files of personal gists in |modifiable| buffers
    -	Open files of non personal gists in |nomodifiable| buffers
    -	Open a gist in the browser (require 'tyru/open-browser.vim')
3.  Post gists
    -	Create a new gist from the current buffer
    -	Create a new gist which contains all opened (or visible) buffers
4.  Edit gists (only for the personal gists)
    -	A file content of a particular gist
    -	A description or a publich status (public or private) of a particular
    	gist
    -	Rename a file of a particular gist
    -	Remove a file of a particular gist (Operation cannot be undone in
    	vim-gista interface)
5.  Delete gists (only for the personal gists)
    -	Delete a gist (OPERATION CANNOT BE UNDONE. BE CAREFUL)
6.  Star/Unstar gist
    -	Star/Unstar a gist
7.  Fork gist
    -	Fork a gist

The original concepts and source codes are taken from mattn/gist.vim but most
of codes and strategies are aggressively refactered to establish new
implementations (that why I did not fork the gist.vim but create a new one.)

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*vim-gista-install*

Using a vim plugin manager such as Vundle.vim, neobundle.vim is strongly
recommended, otherwise just copy the repository to your vim directory (such as
`~/.vim/` or `$HOME/_vim`.)

Vundle
>
    Plugin 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'
<

neobundle.vim
>
    NeoBundle 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'

    " with Lazy
    NeoBundleLazy 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
	\ 'autoload': {
	\   'commands': ['Gista'],
	\   'mappings': '<Plug>(gista-',
	\}}
<
Additionally, if you want to enable a browser feature, you need to install
'tyru/open-browser.vim' as well.

Vundle
>
    Plugin 'tyru/open-browser.vim'
    Plugin 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'
<

neobundle.vim
>
    NeoBundle 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {'depends': ['tyru/open-browser.vim']}

    " with Lazy
    NeoBundleLazy 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
	\ 'depends': ['tyru/open-browser.vim'],
	\ 'autoload': {
	\   'commands': ['Gista'],
	\   'mappings': '<Plug>(gista-',
	\}}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements					*vim-gista-requirements*

vim-gista use 'cURL' or 'wget' to communicate data with GitHub API.
Thus make sure that one of these commands is enabled in your system.

-   cURL - http://curl.haxx.se/
-   Wget - https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup						*vim-gista-setup*

You need to specify your GitHub username first. Use |g:gista#github_user| or
|g:github_user| to specify it in your vimrc like
>
    let g:gista#github_user = 'lambdalisue'
<
If you want to specify it via 'git' command, you need to run the following
commands to specify the GitHub username. After that, |vim-gista| automatically
get your username from 'git' command.
>
    $ git config --global github.user <username>
<

==============================================================================
USAGE						*vim-gista-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List gists     					*vim-gista-usage-list*

List your gists with the following command, it will recursively download all
your gist entries at first thus be patient if you have tons of gists.
The downloaded gists are cached in your file system thus second run should not
take a time.
>
    :Gista -l
<
If you prefer a long option, use '--list' like
>
    :Gista --list
<
After all gists are downloaded, a buffer called 'gista:list' will be opened.
You can manipulate your gist in this window. The default key mappings are

<C-l>	    <Plug>(gista-action-update)          Update list
<C-l><C-l>  <Plug>(gista-action-update-nocache)  Update list without using a
						 cache
+	    <Plug>(gista-action-star)		 Star the selected gist
-	    <Plug>(gista-action-unstar)          Unstar the selected gist
?	    <Plug>(gista-action-is-starred)      Check if the selected gist is
						 starred or not
r	    <Plug>(gista-action-rename)          Rename the selected file of
						 the gist
D	    <Plug>(gista-action-smart-delete)    Remove the selected file of
						 the gist or delete the
						 selected gist. Determined
						 from the cursor position.
F	    <Plug>(gista-action-fork)            Fork the selected gist
<CR>	    <Plug>(gista-action-open)		 Open the selected file or the
						 files of the gist
<S-CR>	    <Plug>(gista-action-browser)         Open the selected file or the
						 gist in a browser

If you don't want to let vim-gista to define these mappings, set
|g:gista#no_default_mappings| to 0.

If you want to list gists of a specific user, specify the username like:
>
    :Gista --list lambdalisue
<
Then all public gists of the specified user will be recursively downloaded and
shown. These gists are also cached in the file system.
If you specify 'starred' to the option, you will see your starred gists.
>
    :Gista --list starred
<
If you want to list public gists in GitHub, specify 'public' to the
option. Note that these gists are NOT loaded recursively and NOT cached in the
file system while there are over 100 pages of the public gists.
>
    :Gista --list public
<
If you want to specify a particular page of the gist, specify the page index
with '--page PAGE' option then only the gists in the particular page will be
downloaded and shown. In this case, the downloaded gists are not cached even
you are listing your own gists.
>
    :Gista --list public --page 2
<
If you desire to reload gists without using cache, specify '--nocache' option
then all gists are re-downloaded and the cache will be updated.
>
    :Gista -l --nocache
<
Or you can simply type <C-l><C-l> in gist list window if you enable the
default key mapping (Otherwise map |<Plug>(gista-action-update-nocache)|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a gist/gists      					*vim-gista-usage-open*

In a gist list window, simply type <CR> to open the gist if you enable the
default key mapping (Otherwise map |<Plug>(gista-open-gist)|.)
If the cursor is under a particular file, it will open the file otherwise it
will open the all files in the gist.

If you want to open a specific gist, specify gist ID with "GistID: XXXXXXXXXX"
format on the current buffer or specify it to the '--gistid' option. You may
want to specify a parcitular filenames, then use '--filename' option.
The command will be like
>
    :Gista -o --gistid XXXXXXXXXX
    :Gista --open --gistid XXXXXXXXXX --filename "A.txt;B.txt.C.txt"
<
If the opened gist is your own gist, the buffer will be |modifiable|
and connected to the gist, mean that the changes on the buffer will be
uploaded when you save the buffer.
Otherwise the buffer will be |nomodifiable|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post a gist/gists      				*vim-gista-usage-post*

If you want to create a new gist, use one of the command below then the
content of the current buffer will be posted and a new gist will be created
(you can specify a selected text as well):
>
    " Long form
    :Gista --post
    :'<.'>Gista --post

    " Short form
    :Gista
    :'<.'>Gista
<
After you post the content, the buffer will be connected to the gist.
That mean the chages will be uploaded to the gist as well when you saved it.
To prevent this feature, see |g:gista#auto_connect_after_post|.
If you want to disconnect the buffer from the connected gist, use the
following command on the buffer.
>
    :Gista --disconnect
<
Then the buffer will be disconnected from the gist and no changes are
uploaded to the gist.

If a gist ID (like 'GistID: XXXXXXXX') is written in the content, or the gist
ID is specified to the command, or the buffer is a gist buffer, the command
will post a changes to the specified gist instead of creating a new gist.
>
    :Gista --gistid XXXXXXXX
<
Thus once you create a new gist, simply execute `:Gista` when you want to
update the changes (or simply save it if |g:gista#auto_write| is non 0).

If you want to specify a description in the command, use '-d' or
'--description' option to specify:
>
    :Gista -d "Description with a short option"
    :Gista --description "Description with a long option"
<
If you want to specify a publish status, use '-p' or '--private' to make the
gist private, use '-P' or '--public' to make the gist public (the default
publish status is determined by the value of |g:gista#use_private_as_default|.
>
    :Gista -p	     -d "This is a private gist"
    :Gista --private -d "This is a private gist"
    :Gista -P	     -d "This is a public gist"
    :Gista --public  -d "This is a public gist"
<
If you want to update the gist as an anonymous gist, use '--anonymous'
option
>
    :Gista --anonymous
<
If you want to create a new gist with all opened buffer. Specify '--multiple'
to the command like
>
    :Gista --multiple
<
Again, if the gist ID is specified to the command, the command will post all
opened buffer to the specified gist (it will replace the content if a same
filename file exists on the gist).
>
    :Gista --post XXXXXXXX --multiple
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit a gist/gists				*vim-gista-usage-edit*

If the current buffer is connected to the gist (if you open or post the gist),
all changes you saved will be uploaded to the gist.
To regulate this feature, see |g:gista#auto_connect| or |g:gista#auto_write|
options.
If you want to update the changes via a command, see |vim-gista-usage-post|
section.

						*vim-gista-usage-rename*
If you want to rename the filename, hit 'r' on the target file in the gist
list window if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise use
|<Plug>(gista-action-rename)|.)
Or if you want to rename the filename of the current gist buffer, use the
command below:
>
    :Gista --rename
    :Gista --rename NEW_FILENAME
<
If you don't specify the new filename in the command, vim-gista will ask it.

						*vim-gista-usage-remove*
If you want to remove a file, hit 'D' on the target file in the gist list
window if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise use
|<Plug>(gista-action-smart-delete)| or |<Plug>(gista-action-remove)|.)
Or if you want to remove the file of the current gist buffer, use the command
below:
>
    :Gista --remove
<
Remove command cannot be undone thus confirmation dialog will comes up.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete a gist  					*vim-gista-usage-delete*

If you want to delete a gist, hit 'D' on the target gist in the gist list
window if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise use
|<Plug>(gista-action-smart-delete)| or |<Plug>(gista-action-delete)|.)
Or if you want to delete the gist connected to the current gist buffer, use
the command below:
>
    :Gista --delete
<
Delete command cannot be undone thus confirmation dialog will comes up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Star/Unstar a gist  	       			*vim-gista-usage-star*
			       			*vim-gista-usage-unstar*
If you want to star/unstar a gist, hit '+' or '-' on the target gist in the
gist list window if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise see
|<Plug>(gista-action-star)| or |<Plug>(gista-action-unstar)|.)
Or if you want to star/unstar the gist connected to the current gist buffer,
use the commands below:
>
    :Gista --star
    :Gista --unstar
<
While GitHub API does not contain the information about starred status of the
gist, vim-gista does not know whether the gist is starred or not.
If you want to display if the gist is starred, use the following command or
hit '?' in the gist list window.
>
    :Gista --is-starred
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fork a gist				   	*vim-gista-usage-fork*

If you want to fork a gist, hit 'F' on the target gist in the gist list window
if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise see
|<Plug>(gista-action-fork)|.)
Or if you want to fork the gist connected to the current gist buffer, use the
command below:
>
    :Gista --fork
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Browse a gist				   	*vim-gista-usage-browse*

If you want to browse a gist in your browser, hit '<S-CR>' on the target gist
in the gist list window if you enable the default key mappings (otherwise see
|<Plug>(gista-action-browse)|.)
Or if you want to browse the gist connected to the current gist buffer, use
one of the commands below:
>
    :Gista -b
    :Gista --browse
<
This feature require 'tyru/open-browser.vim' plugin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands	       				*vim-gista-commands*
						*:Gista*

							*:Gista-list*
:Gista -l [{lookup}] [--page {page}] [--nocache]
:Gista --list [{lookup}] [--page {page}] [--nocache]
    List gists of {lookup}. If no {lookup} is specified, a current
    authenticated username will be used.

    If {lookup} is 'starred' or 'public', the authenticated user's starred
    gists or public gists in Gist web will be listed respectively.

    If {lookup} is not 'public' and no {page} is specified, the gist entries
    will be downloaded recursively and the entires are cached in the file
    system. If no '--nocache' is specified and there is a cache file of the
    specific {lookup}, this command will download the gists updated since the
    corresponding cache file was created.

    If {page} is specified, the command will download the gists only on the
    {page} and never cache the results. It is quite useful to see 'public'
    gists while the number of gists are too any and these are updated too
    frequently.

    If '--nocache' is specified, the command re-download all gists from the
    web site and re-cache the results. It is useful to rebuild your cache.

							*Gista-post*
:Gista [--gistid {gistid}] [--filename {filename}]
	[-d,--description {description}] [--multiple]
	[-p,--private | -P,--public | -a,--anonymous]
:Gista --post [--gistid {gistid}] [--filename {filename}]
	[-d,--description {description}] [--multiple]
	[-p,--private | -P,--public | -a,--anonymous]
    Post or save a gist. If {gistid} is specified or found from the current
    buffer, it will update the content. Otherwise it will create a new gist.

							*:Gista-open*
:Gista -o [--gistid {gistid}] [--filename {filename}]
:Gista --open [--gistid {gistid}] [--filename {filename}]
    Open specified files of the gist. The files are specified in semi-colon
    separated filenames (e.g. `--filename "A.txt;B.txt"). If no {filename} is
    specified, it will open all files in the gist.

    If no {gistid} is specified, it will tried to find the gist ID from the
    current buffer (in "GistID: XXXXXXXXXX" format). If no gist ID is found,
    it will complain like "No gist ID is specified. It require gist ID."

    If you open your personal gist, the buffer will be |modifiable| and will
    be connected to the gist, mean that you can update the changes with
    `:Gista` command (or `:w`, `:w!` if |g:gista#update_on_write| is not 0).
    Otherwise the buffer will be |nomodifiable|.
    Note that the |buftype| of the buffer will be 'acwrite' thus you need
    to specify an actual filename like below if you want to save the buffer on
    your file system. If you give an actual filename with |:w| command, the
    buffer will be disconnected from the gist and the |buftype| will be a
    default value.
